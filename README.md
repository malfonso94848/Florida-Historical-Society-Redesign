# Important Notice
This was a school project I created as part of an assignment along side various group members. This was performed for the experience or redesigning a content-heavy website, not for profit or personal gain. All images, content, and links used are not owned by my group members, me or by the University of Central Florida.

Additionally, the current usage of PHP utilizes backend storage via mySQUL. This has NOT been properly implimented within GitHub Pages. This should only effect the "Events" page and as such, I advise you to not press the page as it will only result in the downloading of the PHP file. That being said, I hope you enjoy browsing!
