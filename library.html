      <h2>The FHS Library of Florida History</h2>
      <p>
        The first library was housed in Cordova Hotel in St. Augustine, before
        moving to Jacksonville,<br />
        Gainesville and Tampa over the course of the next few decades. In 1997,
        the Library of Florida History was<br />
        established in Historic Village in Brevard County, where we still reside
        today. Our library is housed<br />
        within a historic post office, originally constructed in 1939 by WPA. We
        offer patrons the opportunity to<br />
        conduct in-house research during normal business hours. No research fee
        or membership is required to<br />
        conduct research at our facility, however, due to the rarity of many of
        the materials in the collection, and the<br />
        volume of research requests received, we request that patrons first
        schedule an appointment with the<br />
        archivist ahead of a visit so that we can pull material for you.

      <p>
        The scope of the collections housed at the FHS Library consist of any

        to Florida's history and pre-history. We have over 8,000 bound library

        Library also has a collection of rare books including original
        territorial-period government publications, first<br />
        edition, or limited printed fiction and non-fiction titles, as well as
        early Spanish period narrative histories of<br />
        Florida. The archival collection consists of over 10,000 print
        photographs organized by subject and by county.<br />
        The Ada E. Parrish Postcard Collection is comprised of over 15,000
        postcards organized geographically. We<br />
        house over 1,000 early Florida maps, including a collection of 19th
        century plat maps, early colonial period<br />
        (1500,1800) maps, county soil surveys, and many other types.
